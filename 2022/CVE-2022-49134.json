        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum: Guard against invalid local ports\n\nWhen processing events generated by the device's firmware, the driver\nprotects itself from events reported for non-existent local ports, but\nnot for the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but does not have all\nthe fields as any local port.\n\nThis can result in a NULL pointer dereference when trying access\n'struct mlxsw_sp_port' fields which are not initialized for CPU port.\n\nCommit 63b08b1f6834 (\"mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware\")\nalready handled such issue by bailing early when processing a PUDE event\nreported for the CPU port.\n\nGeneralize the approach by moving the check to a common function and\nmaking use of it in all relevant places.",
