In that case,\nthe offset is 0 because the tx queues are in the single existing channel\nat index 0, together with the rx queue.\n\nWithout this fix, as soon as you try to send any traffic, it tries to\nget the tx queues from an uninitialized channel getting these errors:\n  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at drivers/net/ethernet/sfc/tx.c:540 efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc]\n  [...]\n  RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc]\n  [...]\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cIRQ\u003e\n   dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230\n   sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360\n   __dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40\n  [...]\n  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020\n  [...]\n  RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]\n  [...]\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cIRQ\u003e\n   dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230\n   sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360\n   __dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40\n  [...]",
