        "description": "Silverware Games is a social network where people can play games online. Users can attach URLs to YouTube videos, the site will generate related `\u003ciframe\u003e` when the post will be published. The handler has some sort of protection so non-YouTube links can't be posted, as well as HTML tags are being stripped. However, it was still possible to add custom HTML attributes (e.g. `onclick=alert(\"xss\")`) to the `\u003ciframe\u003e'. This issue was fixed in the version `1.1.34` and does not require any extra actions from our members. There has been no evidence that this vulnerability was used by anyone at this time.",
