        "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input within requests as part of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating requests to the web-based management interface to contain operating system commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web services user.\r\n\r Cisco has not yet released software updates that address this vulnerability.
