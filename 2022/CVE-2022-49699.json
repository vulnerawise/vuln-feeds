        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfilemap: Handle sibling entries in filemap_get_read_batch()\n\nIf a read races with an invalidation followed by another read, it is\npossible for a folio to be replaced with a higher-order folio.  If that\nhappens, we'll see a sibling entry for the new folio in the next iteration\nof the loop.  This manifests as a NULL pointer dereference while holding\nthe RCU read lock.\n\nHandle this by simply returning.  The next call will find the new folio\nand handle it correctly.  The other ways of handling this rare race are\nmore complex and it's just not worth it.",
