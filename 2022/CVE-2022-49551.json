        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: isp1760: Fix out-of-bounds array access\n\nRunning the driver through kasan gives an interesting splat:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in isp1760_register+0x180/0x70c\n  Read of size 20 at addr f1db2e64 by task swapper/0/1\n  (...)\n  isp1760_register from isp1760_plat_probe+0x1d8/0x220\n  (...)\n\nThis happens because the loop reading the regmap fields for the\ndifferent ISP1760 variants look like this:\n\n  for (i = 0; i \u003c HC_FIELD_MAX; i++) { ... }\n\nMeaning it expects the arrays to be at least HC_FIELD_MAX - 1 long.\n\nHowever the arrays isp1760_hc_reg_fields[], isp1763_hc_reg_fields[],\nisp1763_hc_volatile_ranges[] and isp1763_dc_volatile_ranges[] are\ndynamically sized during compilation.\n\nFix this by putting an empty assignment to the [HC_FIELD_MAX]\nand [DC_FIELD_MAX] array member at the end of each array.\nThis will make the array one member longer than it needs to be,\nbut avoids the risk of overwriting whatever is inside\n[HC_FIELD_MAX - 1] and is simple and intuitive to read. Also\nadd comments explaining what is going on.",
