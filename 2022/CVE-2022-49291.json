        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent hw_params and hw_free calls\n\nCurrently we have neither proper check nor protection against the\nconcurrent calls of PCM hw_params and hw_free ioctls, which may result\nin a UAF.  Since the existing PCM stream lock can't be used for\nprotecting the whole ioctl operations, we need a new mutex to protect\nthose racy calls.\n\nThis patch introduced a new mutex, runtime-\u003ebuffer_mutex, and applies\nit to both hw_params and hw_free ioctl code paths.  Along with it, the\nboth functions are slightly modified (the mmap_count check is moved\ninto the state-check block) for code simplicity.",
