        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix combination of jit blinding and pointers to bpf subprogs.\n\nThe combination of jit blinding and pointers to bpf subprogs causes:\n[   36.989548] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000100000001\n[   36.990342] #PF: supervisor instruction fetch in kernel mode\n[   36.990968] #PF: error_code(0x0010) - not-present page\n[   36.994859] RIP: 0010:0x100000001\n[   36.995209] Code: Unable to access opcode bytes at RIP 0xffffffd7.\n[   37.004091] Call Trace:\n[   37.004351]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[   37.004576]  ? bpf_loop+0x4d/0x70\n[   37.004932]  ? bpf_prog_3899083f75e4c5de_F+0xe3/0x13b\n\nThe jit blinding logic didn't recognize that ld_imm64 with an address\nof bpf subprogram is a special instruction and proceeded to randomize it.\nBy itself it wouldn't have been an issue, but jit_subprogs() logic\nrelies on two step process to JIT all subprogs and then JIT them\nagain when addresses of all subprogs are known.\nBlinding process in the first JIT phase caused second JIT to miss\nadjustment of special ld_imm64.\n\nFix this issue by ignoring special ld_imm64 instructions that don't have\nuser controlled constants and shouldn't be blinded.",
