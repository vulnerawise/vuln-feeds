        "description": "An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated network based attacker to cause 100% CPU load and the device to become unresponsive by sending a flood of traffic to the out-of-band management ethernet port. Continued receipted of a flood will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the flood subsides the system will recover by itself. An indication that the system is affected by this issue would be that an irq handled by the fman process is shown to be using a high percentage of CPU cycles like in the following example output: user@host\u003e show system processes extensive ...
