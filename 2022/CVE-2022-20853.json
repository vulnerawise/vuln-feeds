An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the REST API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload.\r\nCisco\u0026nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\u0026nbsp;",
