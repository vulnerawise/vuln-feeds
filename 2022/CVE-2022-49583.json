        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niavf: Fix handling of dummy receive descriptors\n\nFix memory leak caused by not handling dummy receive descriptor properly.\niavf_get_rx_buffer now sets the rx_buffer return value for dummy receive\ndescriptors. Without this patch, when the hardware writes a dummy\ndescriptor, iavf would not free the page allocated for the previous receive\nbuffer. This is an unlikely event but can still happen.\n\n[Jesse: massaged commit message]",
