        "description": "An issue was discovered in Blue Prism Enterprise 6.0 through 7.01. In a misconfigured environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for an administrative function. If credential access is configured to be accessible by a machine or the runtime resource security group, using further reverse engineering, an attacker can spoof a known machine and request known encrypted credentials to decrypt later.",
