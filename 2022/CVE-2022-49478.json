        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: pvrusb2: fix array-index-out-of-bounds in pvr2_i2c_core_init\n\nSyzbot reported that -1 is used as array index. The problem was in\nmissing validation check.\n\nhdw-\u003eunit_number is initialized with -1 and then if init table walk fails\nthis value remains unchanged. Since code blindly uses this member for\narray indexing adding sanity check is the easiest fix for that.\n\nhdw-\u003eworkpoll initialization moved upper to prevent warning in\n__flush_work.",
