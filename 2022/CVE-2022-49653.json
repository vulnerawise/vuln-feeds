        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: piix4: Fix a memory leak in the EFCH MMIO support\n\nThe recently added support for EFCH MMIO regions introduced a memory\nleak in that code path. The leak is caused by the fact that\nrelease_resource() merely removes the resource from the tree but does\nnot free its memory. We need to call release_mem_region() instead,\nwhich does free the memory. As a nice side effect, this brings back\nsome symmetry between the legacy and MMIO paths.",
