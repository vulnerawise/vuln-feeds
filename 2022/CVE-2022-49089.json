        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nIB/rdmavt: add lock to call to rvt_error_qp to prevent a race condition\n\nThe documentation of the function rvt_error_qp says both r_lock and s_lock\nneed to be held when calling that function.  It also asserts using lockdep\nthat both of those locks are held.  However, the commit I referenced in\nFixes accidentally makes the call to rvt_error_qp in rvt_ruc_loopback no\nlonger covered by r_lock.  This results in the lockdep assertion failing\nand also possibly in a race condition.",
