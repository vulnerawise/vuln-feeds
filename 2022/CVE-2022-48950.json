        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf: Fix perf_pending_task() UaF\n\nPer syzbot it is possible for perf_pending_task() to run after the\nevent is free()'d. There are two related but distinct cases:\n\n - the task_work was already queued before destroying the event;\n - destroying the event itself queues the task_work.\n\nThe first cannot be solved using task_work_cancel() since\nperf_release() itself might be called from a task_work (____fput),\nwhich means the current-\u003etask_works list is already empty and\ntask_work_cancel() won't be able to find the perf_pending_task()\nentry.\n\nThe simplest alternative is extending the perf_event lifetime to cover\nthe task_work.\n\nThe second is just silly, queueing a task_work while you know the\nevent is going away makes no sense and is easily avoided by\nre-arranging how the event is marked STATE_DEAD and ensuring it goes\nthrough STATE_OFF on the way down.",
