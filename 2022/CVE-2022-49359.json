        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panfrost: Job should reference MMU not file_priv\n\nFor a while now it's been allowed for a MMU context to outlive it's\ncorresponding panfrost_priv, however the job structure still references\npanfrost_priv to get hold of the MMU context. If panfrost_priv has been\nfreed this is a use-after-free which I've been able to trigger resulting\nin a splat.\n\nTo fix this, drop the reference to panfrost_priv in the job structure\nand add a direct reference to the MMU structure which is what's actually\nneeded.",
