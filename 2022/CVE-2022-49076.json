        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hfi1: Fix use-after-free bug for mm struct\n\nUnder certain conditions, such as MPI_Abort, the hfi1 cleanup code may\nrepresent the last reference held on the task mm.\nhfi1_mmu_rb_unregister() then drops the last reference and the mm is freed\nbefore the final use in hfi1_release_user_pages().  A new task may\nallocate the mm structure while it is still being used, resulting in\nproblems. One manifestation is corruption of the mmap_sem counter leading\nto a hang in down_write().  Another is corruption of an mm struct that is\nin use by another task.",
