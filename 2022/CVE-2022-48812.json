        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: lantiq_gswip: don't use devres for mdiobus\n\nAs explained in commits:\n74b6d7d13307 (\"net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres\")\n5135e96a3dd2 (\"net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres\")\n\nmdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() \u003c-\ndevres_release_all() \u003c- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus was\nnot previously unregistered.\n\nThe GSWIP switch is a platform device, so the initial set of constraints\nthat I thought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call -\u003eremove on\n-\u003eshutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which applies here.\n\nIf the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls -\u003eremove from -\u003eshutdown\n(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link\nbetween the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()\nwill unbind the GSWIP switch driver on shutdown.\n\nSo the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which\nis: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,\nor don't use devres at all.\n\nThe gswip driver has the code structure in place for orderly mdiobus\nremoval, so just replace devm_mdiobus_alloc() with the non-devres\nvariant, and add manual free where necessary, to ensure that we don't\nlet devres free a still-registered bus.",
