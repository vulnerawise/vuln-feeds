        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: filter out EXT4_FC_REPLAY from on-disk superblock field s_state\n\nThe EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit in sbi-\u003es_mount_state is used to indicate that\nwe are in the middle of replay the fast commit journal.  This was\nactually a mistake, since the sbi-\u003es_mount_info is initialized from\nes-\u003es_state.  Arguably s_mount_state is misleadingly named, but the\nname is historical --- s_mount_state and s_state dates back to ext2.\n\nWhat should have been used is the ext4_{set,clear,test}_mount_flag()\ninline functions, which sets EXT4_MF_* bits in sbi-\u003es_mount_flags.\n\nThe problem with using EXT4_FC_REPLAY is that a maliciously corrupted\nsuperblock could result in EXT4_FC_REPLAY getting set in\ns_mount_state.  This bypasses some sanity checks, and this can trigger\na BUG() in ext4_es_cache_extent().  As a easy-to-backport-fix, filter\nout the EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit for now.  We should eventually transition\naway from EXT4_FC_REPLAY to something like EXT4_MF_REPLAY.",
