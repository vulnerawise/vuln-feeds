        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkernel/resource: fix kfree() of bootmem memory again\n\nSince commit ebff7d8f270d (\"mem hotunplug: fix kfree() of bootmem\nmemory\"), we could get a resource allocated during boot via\nalloc_resource().  And it's required to release the resource using\nfree_resource().  Howerver, many people use kfree directly which will\nresult in kernel BUG.  In order to fix this without fixing every call\nsite, just leak a couple of bytes in such corner case.",
