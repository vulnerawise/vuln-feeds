        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder\n\nNot all decoders have a reset callback.\n\nThe CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port to\nhave no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes there\nare none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoder\ninstance without a commit/reset callback.\n\nPrior to this patch, the -\u003ereset() callback was called unconditionally when\ncalling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge,\n1 Root Port, and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL\ntype 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null\npointer dereference.\n\nBefore the fix, a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region, and\na pass through decoder is reset.\n\nThe issue can be reproduced as below,\n    1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a\n    single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.\n    2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.",
