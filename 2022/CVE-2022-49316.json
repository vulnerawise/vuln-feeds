        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSv4: Don't hold the layoutget locks across multiple RPC calls\n\nWhen doing layoutget as part of the open() compound, we have to be\ncareful to release the layout locks before we can call any further RPC\ncalls, such as setattr(). The reason is that those calls could trigger\na recall, which could deadlock.",
