        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nafs: Fix dynamic root getattr\n\nThe recent patch to make afs_getattr consult the server didn't account\nfor the pseudo-inodes employed by the dynamic root-type afs superblock\nnot having a volume or a server to access, and thus an oops occurs if\nsuch a directory is stat'd.\n\nFix this by checking to see if the vnode-\u003evolume pointer actually points\nanywhere before following it in afs_getattr().\n\nThis can be tested by stat'ing a directory in /afs.  It may be\nsufficient just to do \"ls /afs\" and the oops looks something like:\n\n        BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020\n        ...\n        RIP: 0010:afs_getattr+0x8b/0x14b\n        ...\n        Call Trace:\n         \u003cTASK\u003e\n         vfs_statx+0x79/0xf5\n         vfs_fstatat+0x49/0x62",
