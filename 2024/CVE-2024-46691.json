        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: typec: ucsi: Move unregister out of atomic section\n\nCommit '9329933699b3 (\"soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Make client-lock\nnon-sleeping\")' moved the pmic_glink client list under a spinlock, as it\nis accessed by the rpmsg/glink callback, which in turn is invoked from\nIRQ context.\n\nThis means that ucsi_unregister() is now called from atomic context,\nwhich isn't feasible as it's expecting a sleepable context. An effort is\nunder way to get GLINK to invoke its callbacks in a sleepable context,\nbut until then lets schedule the unregistration.\n\nA side effect of this is that ucsi_unregister() can now happen\nafter the remote processor, and thereby the communication link with it, is\ngone. pmic_glink_send() is amended with a check to avoid the resulting NULL\npointer dereference.\nThis does however result in the user being informed about this error by\nthe following entry in the kernel log:\n\n  ucsi_glink.pmic_glink_ucsi pmic_glink.ucsi.0: failed to send UCSI write request: -5",
