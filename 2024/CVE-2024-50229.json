        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks\n\nSyzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers\nmemory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in\ncircular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore\nnilfs-\u003ens_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the\nfs_reclaim pseudo lock.\n\nThis is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (\"don't put symlink bodies in\npagecache into highmem\"), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic\nlinks are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().\n\nThis is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because\nthe __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,\nwhen a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain\noverwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from\npage_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,\nwhich may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can\ncause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs-\u003ens_segctor_sem is held:\n\nFix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags\nof newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and\n__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation\nscope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",
