        "description": "Group-Office is an enterprise CRM and groupware tool. Affected versions are subject to a vulnerability which is present in the file upload mechanism of Group Office. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by embedding it within a file's name. For instance, using a filename such as “\u003e\u003cimg src=x onerror=prompt('XSS')\u003e.jpg” triggers the vulnerability. When this file is uploaded, the JavaScript code within the filename is executed. This issue has been addressed in version 6.8.29. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
