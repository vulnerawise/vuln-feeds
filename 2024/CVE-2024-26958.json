        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfs: fix UAF in direct writes\n\nIn production we have been hitting the following warning consistently\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nrefcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.\nWARNING: CPU: 17 PID: 1800359 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0xe0\nWorkqueue: nfsiod nfs_direct_write_schedule_work [nfs]\nRIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0xe0\nPKRU: 55555554\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n ? __warn+0x9f/0x130\n ? refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0xe0\n ? report_bug+0xcc/0x150\n ? handle_bug+0x3d/0x70\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x40\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n ? refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0xe0\n nfs_direct_write_schedule_work+0x237/0x250 [nfs]\n process_one_work+0x12f/0x4a0\n worker_thread+0x14e/0x3b0\n ?

With my patch the stress test has been running for\nseveral hours without popping.",
