        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtnetlink: fix error logic of IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS writing back\n\nIn the commit d73ef2d69c0d (\"rtnetlink: let rtnl_bridge_setlink checks\nIFLA_BRIDGE_MODE length\"), an adjustment was made to the old loop logic\nin the function `rtnl_bridge_setlink` to enable the loop to also check\nthe length of the IFLA_BRIDGE_MODE attribute. However, this adjustment\nremoved the `break` statement and led to an error logic of the flags\nwriting back at the end of this function.\n\nif (have_flags)\n    memcpy(nla_data(attr), \u0026flags, sizeof(flags));\n    // attr should point to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS NLA !!!\n\nBefore the mentioned commit, the `attr` is granted to be IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS.\nHowever, this is not necessarily true fow now as the updated loop will let\nthe attr point to the last NLA, even an invalid NLA which could cause\noverflow writes.\n\nThis patch introduces a new variable `br_flag` to save the NLA pointer\nthat points to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS and uses it to resolve the mentioned\nerror logic.",
