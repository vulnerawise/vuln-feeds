        "description": "The Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6. This is due to missing nonce validation and the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it in the 'wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
