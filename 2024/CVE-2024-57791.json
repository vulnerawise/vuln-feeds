        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/smc: check return value of sock_recvmsg when draining clc data\n\nWhen receiving clc msg, the field length in smc_clc_msg_hdr indicates the\nlength of msg should be received from network and the value should not be\nfully trusted as it is from the network. Once the value of length exceeds\nthe value of buflen in function smc_clc_wait_msg it may run into deadloop\nwhen trying to drain the remaining data exceeding buflen.\n\nThis patch checks the return value of sock_recvmsg when draining data in\ncase of deadloop in draining.",
