        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthermal/debugfs: Fix two locking issues with thermal zone debug\n\nWith the current thermal zone locking arrangement in the debugfs code,\nuser space can open the \"mitigations\" file for a thermal zone before\nthe zone's debugfs pointer is set which will result in a NULL pointer\ndereference in tze_seq_start().\n\nMoreover, thermal_debug_tz_remove() is not called under the thermal\nzone lock, so it can run in parallel with the other functions accessing\nthe thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.  Then, it may clear\ntz-\u003edebugfs after one of those functions has checked it and the\nstruct thermal_debugfs object may be freed prematurely.\n\nTo address the first problem, pass a pointer to the thermal zone's\nstruct thermal_debugfs object to debugfs_create_file() in\nthermal_debug_tz_add() and make tze_seq_start(), tze_seq_next(),\ntze_seq_stop(), and tze_seq_show() retrieve it from s-\u003eprivate\ninstead of a pointer to the thermal zone object.  This will ensure\nthat tz_debugfs will be valid across the \"mitigations\" file accesses\nuntil thermal_debugfs_remove_id() called by thermal_debug_tz_remove()\nremoves that file.\n\nTo address the second problem, use tz-\u003elock in thermal_debug_tz_remove()\naround the tz-\u003edebugfs value check (in case the same thermal zone is\nremoved at the same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.\n\nCc :6.8+ \u003cstable@vger.kernel.org\u003e # 6.8+",
