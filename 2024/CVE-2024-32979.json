        "description": "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. It was discovered that due to improper handling and escaping of user-provided query parameters, a maliciously crafted Nautobot URL could potentially be used to execute a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS) attack against users. All filterable object-list views in Nautobot are vulnerable. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.20 and 2.2.3. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
