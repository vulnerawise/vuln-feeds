        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: bcm: dvp: Assign -\u003enum before accessing -\u003ehws\n\nCommit f316cdff8d67 (\"clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with\n__counted_by\") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'\nwith __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number\nof elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of\nbounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must be\ninitialized with the number of elements before the first array access\nhappens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the\ninitialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in\nclk_dvp_probe() due to -\u003enum being assigned after -\u003ehws has been\naccessed:\n\n  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2711-dvp.c:59:2\n  index 0 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)' (aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')\n\nMove the -\u003enum initialization to before the first access of -\u003ehws, which\nclears up the warning.",
