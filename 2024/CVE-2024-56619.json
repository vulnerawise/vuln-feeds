        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()\n\nSyzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the\ninode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value, memory access outside\nthe folio/page range may occur, or a use-after-free bug may be detected if\nKASAN is enabled.\n\nThis is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry()\nand others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a\npage from i_size and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit\nsize information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which\nthe i_size value is assigned.\n\nThis caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address\ncalculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting in memory access\nthat exceeds the folio/page size.\n\nFix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit\nloss from \"unsigned int\" to \"u64\".  The return value of nilfs_last_byte()\nis also of type \"unsigned int\", but it is truncated so as not to exceed\nPAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required.",
