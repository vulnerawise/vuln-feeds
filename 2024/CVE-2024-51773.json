        "description": "A vulnerability in the HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass Policy Manager web-based management interface could allow an authenticated remote Attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Successful exploitation could enable a threat actor to perform any actions the user is authorized to do, including accessing the user's data and altering information within the user's permissions. This could lead to data modification, deletion, or theft, including unauthorized access to files, file deletion, or the theft of session cookies, which an attacker could use to hijack a user's session.",
