        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: Fix a null pointer crash in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip\n\nIt's possible that mtk_crtc-\u003eevent is NULL in\nmtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip().\n\npending_needs_vblank value is set by mtk_crtc-\u003eevent, but in\nmtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded by the same\nlock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens.\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nCPU1                              CPU2\nstep 1:\nmtk_drm_crtc_atomic_begin()\nmtk_crtc-\u003eevent is not null,\n                                  step 1:\n                                  mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush:\n                                  mtk_drm_crtc_update_config(\n                                      !!mtk_crtc-\u003eevent)\nstep 2:\nmtk_crtc_ddp_irq -\u003e\nmtk_drm_finish_page_flip:\nlock\nmtk_crtc-\u003eevent set to null,\npending_needs_vblank set to false\nunlock\n                                  pending_needs_vblank set to true,\n\n                                  step 2:\n                                  mtk_crtc_ddp_irq -\u003e\n                                  mtk_drm_finish_page_flip called again,\n                                  pending_needs_vblank is still true\n                                  //null pointer\n\nInstead of guarding the entire mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's more\nefficient to just check if mtk_crtc-\u003eevent is null before use.",
