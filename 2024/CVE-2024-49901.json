        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/adreno: Assign msm_gpu-\u003epdev earlier to avoid nullptrs\n\nThere are some cases, such as the one uncovered by Commit 46d4efcccc68\n(\"drm/msm/a6xx: Avoid a nullptr dereference when speedbin setting fails\")\nwhere\n\nmsm_gpu_cleanup() : platform_set_drvdata(gpu-\u003epdev, NULL);\n\nis called on gpu-\u003epdev == NULL, as the GPU device has not been fully\ninitialized yet.\n\nTurns out that there's more than just the aforementioned path that\ncauses this to happen (e.g. the case when there's speedbin data in the\ncatalog, but opp-supported-hw is missing in DT).\n\nAssigning msm_gpu-\u003epdev earlier seems like the least painful solution\nto this, therefore do so.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/602742/",
