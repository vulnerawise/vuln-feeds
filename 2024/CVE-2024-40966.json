        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: add the option to have a tty reject a new ldisc\n\n... and use it to limit the virtual terminals to just N_TTY.  They are\nkind of special, and in particular, the \"con_write()\" routine violates\nthe \"writes cannot sleep\" rule that some ldiscs rely on.\n\nThis avoids the\n\n   BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/printk/printk.c:2659\n\nwhen N_GSM has been attached to a virtual console, and gsmld_write()\ncalls con_write() while holding a spinlock, and con_write() then tries\nto get the console lock.",
