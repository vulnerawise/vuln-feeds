        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm: Fix pti_clone_pgtable() alignment assumption\n\nGuenter reported dodgy crashes on an i386-nosmp build using GCC-11\nthat had the form of endless traps until entry stack exhaust and then\n#DF from the stack guard.\n\nIt turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions on\nthe start address, notably it hard assumes start is PMD aligned. This\nis true on x86_64, but very much not true on i386.\n\nThese assumptions can cause the end condition to malfunction, leading\nto a 'short' clone. Guess what happens when the user mapping has a\nshort copy of the entry text?\n\nUse the correct increment form for addr to avoid alignment\nassumptions.",
