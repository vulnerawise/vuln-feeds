        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gic-v3-its: Restore quirk probing for ACPI-based systems\n\nWhile refactoring the way the ITSs are probed, the handling of quirks\napplicable to ACPI-based platforms was lost. As a result, systems such as\nHIP07 lose their GICv4 functionnality, and some other may even fail to\nboot, unless they are configured to boot with DT.\n\nMove the enabling of quirks into its_probe_one(), making it common to all\nfirmware implementations.",
