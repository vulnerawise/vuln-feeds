        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinder: signal epoll threads of self-work\n\nIn (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when\ndata is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a\ncommand via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make use\nof epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards.\n\nIt is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they\nqueue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an\nevent leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands\nwon't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work.",
