        "description": "The Versa Director offers REST APIs for orchestration and management. By design, certain APIs, such as the login screen, banner display, and device registration, do not require authentication. However, it was discovered that for Directors directly connected to the Internet, one of these APIs can be exploited by injecting invalid arguments into a GET request, potentially exposing the authentication tokens of other currently logged-in users. These tokens can then be used to invoke additional APIs on port 9183. This exploit does not disclose any username or password information. \r\n\r\nCurrently, there are no workarounds in Versa Director. However, if there is Web Application Firewall (WAF) or API Gateway fronting the Versa Director, it can be used to block access to the URLs of vulnerable API.  /vnms/devicereg/device/* (on ports 9182 \u0026 9183) and /versa/vnms/devicereg/device/* (on port 443). Versa recommends that Directors be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions. This vulnerability is not exploitable on Versa Directors not exposed to the Internet.We have validated that no Versa-hosted head ends have been affected by this vulnerability. Please contact Versa Technical Support or Versa account team for any further assistance.",
