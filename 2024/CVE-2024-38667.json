        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threads\n\nTop of the kernel thread stack should be reserved for pt_regs. However\nthis is not the case for the idle threads of the secondary boot harts.\nTheir stacks overlap with their pt_regs, so both may get corrupted.\n\nSimilar issue has been fixed for the primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28\n(\"riscv: prevent stack corruption by reserving task_pt_regs(p) early\").\nHowever that fix was not propagated to the secondary harts. The problem\nhas been noticed in some CPU hotplug tests with V enabled. The function\nsmp_callin stored several registers on stack, corrupting top of pt_regs\nstructure including status field. As a result, kernel attempted to save\nor restore inexistent V context.",
