        "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Industrial Wireless Software for Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (URWB) Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks with root privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system of the affected device.",
