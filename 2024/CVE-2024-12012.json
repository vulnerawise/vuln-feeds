        "description": "A CWE-598 “Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings” was discovered affecting the 130.8005 TCP/IP Gateway running firmware version 12h. Both the SHA-1 hash of the password as well as the session tokens are included as part of the URL and therefore exposed to information leakage scenarios. An attacker capable of accessing such values (e.g., victim browser, network traffic inspection) can exploit this vulnerability to leak both the password hash as well as session tokens and bypass the authentication mechanism using a pass-the-hash attack.",
