        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngve: guard XDP xmit NDO on existence of xdp queues\n\nIn GVE, dedicated XDP queues only exist when an XDP program is installed\nand the interface is up. As such, the NDO XDP XMIT callback should\nreturn early if either of these conditions are false.\n\nIn the case of no loaded XDP program, priv-\u003enum_xdp_queues=0 which can\ncause a divide-by-zero error, and in the case of interface down,\nnum_xdp_queues remains untouched to persist XDP queue count for the next\ninterface up, but the TX pointer itself would be NULL.\n\nThe XDP xmit callback also needs to synchronize with a device\ntransitioning from open to close. This synchronization will happen via\nthe GVE_PRIV_FLAGS_NAPI_ENABLED bit along with a synchronize_net() call,\nwhich waits for any RCU critical sections at call-time to complete.",
