        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: uvc: use correct buffer size when parsing configfs lists\n\nThis commit fixes uvc gadget support on 32-bit platforms.\n\nCommit 0df28607c5cb (\"usb: gadget: uvc: Generalise helper functions for\nreuse\") introduced a helper function __uvcg_iter_item_entries() to aid\nwith parsing lists of items on configfs attributes stores. This function\nis a generalization of another very similar function, which used a\nstack-allocated temporary buffer of fixed size for each item in the list\nand used the sizeof() operator to check for potential buffer overruns.\nThe new function was changed to allocate the now variably sized temp\nbuffer on heap, but wasn't properly updated to also check for max buffer\nsize using the computed size instead of sizeof() operator.\n\nAs a result, the maximum item size was 7 (plus null terminator) on\n64-bit platforms, and 3 on 32-bit ones. While 7 is accidentally just\nbarely enough, 3 is definitely too small for some of UVC configfs\nattributes. For example, dwFrameInteval, specified in 100ns units,\nusually has 6-digit item values, e.g. 166666 for 60fps.",
