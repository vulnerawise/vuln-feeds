        "description": "SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform allows an authenticated attacker to gain higher access levels than they should have by exploiting improper authorization checks, resulting in privilege escalation. While authorizations for import and export are distinguished, a single authorization is applied for both, which may contribute to these risks. On successful exploitation, this can result in potential security concerns. However, it has no impact on the integrity and availability of the application and may have only a low impact on data confidentiality.",
