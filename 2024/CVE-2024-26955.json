        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: prevent kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()\n\nFix a bug where nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status when\nsearching and inserting the specified block both fail inconsistently.  If\nthis inconsistent behavior is not due to a previously fixed bug, then an\nunexpected race is occurring, so return a temporary error -EAGAIN instead.\n\nThis prevents callers such as __block_write_begin_int() from requesting a\nread into a buffer that is not mapped, which would cause the BUG_ON check\nfor the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc() to fail.",
