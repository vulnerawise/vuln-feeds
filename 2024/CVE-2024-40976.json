        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/lima: mask irqs in timeout path before hard reset\n\nThere is a race condition in which a rendering job might take just long\nenough to trigger the drm sched job timeout handler but also still\ncomplete before the hard reset is done by the timeout handler.\nThis runs into race conditions not expected by the timeout handler.\nIn some very specific cases it currently may result in a refcount\nimbalance on lima_pm_idle, with a stack dump such as:\n\n[10136.669170] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at drivers/gpu/drm/lima/lima_devfreq.c:205 lima_devfreq_record_idle+0xa0/0xb0\n...\n[10136.669459] pc : lima_devfreq_record_idle+0xa0/0xb0\n...\n[10136.669628] Call trace:\n[10136.669634]  lima_devfreq_record_idle+0xa0/0xb0\n[10136.669646]  lima_sched_pipe_task_done+0x5c/0xb0\n[10136.669656]  lima_gp_irq_handler+0xa8/0x120\n[10136.669666]  __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x48/0x160\n[10136.669679]  handle_irq_event+0x4c/0xc0\n\nWe can prevent that race condition entirely by masking the irqs at the\nbeginning of the timeout handler, at which point we give up on waiting\nfor that job entirely.\nThe irqs will be enabled again at the next hard reset which is already\ndone as a recovery by the timeout handler.",
