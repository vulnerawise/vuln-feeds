        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: check discard support for conventional zones\n\nAs the helper function f2fs_bdev_support_discard() shows, f2fs checks if\nthe target block devices support discard by calling\nbdev_max_discard_sectors() and bdev_is_zoned(). This check works well\nfor most cases, but it does not work for conventional zones on zoned\nblock devices. F2fs assumes that zoned block devices support discard,\nand calls __submit_discard_cmd(). When __submit_discard_cmd() is called\nfor sequential write required zones, it works fine since\n__submit_discard_cmd() issues zone reset commands instead of discard\ncommands. However, when __submit_discard_cmd() is called for\nconventional zones, __blkdev_issue_discard() is called even when the\ndevices do not support discard.\n\nThe inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call was not a problem before\nthe commit 30f1e7241422 (\"block: move discard checks into the ioctl\nhandler\") because __blkdev_issue_discard() checked if the target devices\nsupport discard or not. If not, it returned EOPNOTSUPP. After the\ncommit, __blkdev_issue_discard() no longer checks it. It always returns\nzero and sets NULL to the given bio pointer. This NULL pointer triggers\nf2fs_bug_on() in __submit_discard_cmd(). The BUG is recreated with the\ncommands below at the umount step, where /dev/nullb0 is a zoned null_blk\nwith 5GB total size, 128MB zone size and 10 conventional zones.\n\n$ mkfs.f2fs -f -m /dev/nullb0\n$ mount /dev/nullb0 /mnt\n$ for ((i=0;i\u003c5;i++)); do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test bs=65536 count=1600 conv=fsync; done\n$ umount /mnt\n\nTo fix the BUG, avoid the inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call.\nWhen discard is requested for conventional zones, check if the device\nsupports discard or not. If not, return EOPNOTSUPP.",
