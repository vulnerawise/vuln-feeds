        "description": "Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. For the `/v2/projects/translations` and `/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations` endpoints, translation data was returned even when API key was missing `translation.view` scope. However, it was impossible to fetch the data when user was missing this scope. So this is only relevant for API keys generated by users permitted to `translation.view`. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.57.2\n",
