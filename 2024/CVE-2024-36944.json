        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nReapply \"drm/qxl: simplify qxl_fence_wait\"\n\nThis reverts commit 07ed11afb68d94eadd4ffc082b97c2331307c5ea.\n\nStephen Rostedt reports:\n \"I went to run my tests on my VMs and the tests hung on boot up.\n  Unfortunately, the most I ever got out was:\n\n  [   93.607888] Testing event system initcall: OK\n  [   93.667730] Running tests on all trace events:\n  [   93.669757] Testing all events: OK\n  [   95.631064] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  Timed out after 60 seconds\"\n\nand further debugging points to a possible circular locking dependency\nbetween the console_owner locking and the worker pool locking.\n\nReverting the commit allows Steve's VM to boot to completion again.\n\n[ This may obviously result in the \"[TTM] Buffer eviction failed\"\n  messages again, which was the reason for that original revert. But at\n  this point this seems preferable to a non-booting system... ]",
