        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread\n\nThis prevents malicious processes from completing random copen/cread\nrequests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below:\n\n  * Generic, copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only\n    complete read requests.\n  * For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the\n    request has not been read by the daemon.\n  * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.",
