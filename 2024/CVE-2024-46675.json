        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: core: Prevent USB core invalid event buffer address access\n\nThis commit addresses an issue where the USB core could access an\ninvalid event buffer address during runtime suspend, potentially causing\nSMMU faults and other memory issues in Exynos platforms. The problem\narises from the following sequence.\n        1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when\n        moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the\n        run/stop bit by software.\n        2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of\n        the USB core's status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and\n        other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event\n        buffer address.\n\nTo prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensures\nthat the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB\ncore is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before\nclearing the buffer address.",
