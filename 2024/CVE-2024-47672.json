        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't wait for tx queues if firmware is dead\n\nThere is a WARNING in iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() (that was\nrecently converted from just a message), that can be hit if we\nwait for TX queues to become empty after firmware died. Clearly,\nwe can't expect anything from the firmware after it's declared dead.\n\nDon't call iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() in this case. While it could\nbe a good idea to stop the flow earlier, the flush functions do some\nmaintenance work that is not related to the firmware, so keep that part\nof the code running even when the firmware is not running.\n\n[edit commit message]",
