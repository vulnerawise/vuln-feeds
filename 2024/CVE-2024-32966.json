        "description": "Static Web Server (SWS) is a tiny and fast production-ready web server suitable to serve static web files or assets. In affected versions if directory listings are enabled for a directory that an untrusted user has upload privileges for, a malicious file name like `\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert(1)\u003e.txt` will allow JavaScript code execution in the context of the web serverâ€™s domain. SWS generally does not perform escaping of HTML entities on any values inserted in the directory listing. At the very least `file_name` and `current_path` could contain malicious data however. `file_uri` could also be malicious but the relevant scenarios seem to be all caught by hyper. For any web server that allow users to upload files or create directories under a name of their choosing this becomes a stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
