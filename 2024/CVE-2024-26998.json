        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: core: Clearing the circular buffer before NULLifying it\n\nThe circular buffer is NULLified in uart_tty_port_shutdown()\nunder the spin lock. However, the PM or other timer based callbacks\nmay still trigger after this event without knowning that buffer pointer\nis not valid. Since the serial code is a bit inconsistent in checking\nthe buffer state (some rely on the head-tail positions, some on the\nbuffer pointer), it's better to have both aligned, i.e. buffer pointer\nto be NULL and head-tail possitions to be the same, meaning it's empty.\nThis will prevent asynchronous calls to dereference NULL pointer as\nreported recently in 8250 case:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000cf5\n  Workqueue: pm pm_runtime_work\n  EIP: serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)\n  ...\n  ? serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)\n  __start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1551)\n  serial8250_start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1654)\n  serial_port_runtime_suspend (include/linux/serial_core.h:667 drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:63)\n  __rpm_callback (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:393)\n  ? serial_port_remove (drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:50)\n  rpm_suspend (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:447)\n\nThe proposed change will prevent -\u003estart_tx() to be called during\nsuspend on shut down port.",
