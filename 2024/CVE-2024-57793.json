        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirt: tdx-guest: Just leak decrypted memory on unrecoverable errors\n\nIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause\nset_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returned\nand the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care\nto handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional\nor security issues.\n\nLeak the decrypted memory when set_memory_decrypted() fails,\nand don't need to print an error since set_memory_decrypted()\nwill call WARN_ONCE().",
