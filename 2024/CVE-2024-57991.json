        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtw89: chan: fix soft lockup in rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles()\n\nDuring rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles(), there is a normalizing process\nwhich will re-order the list if an entry with target pattern is found.\nAnd once one is found, should have aborted the list_for_each_entry. But,\n`break` just aborted the inner for-loop. The outer list_for_each_entry\nstill continues. Normally, only the first entry will match the target\npattern, and the re-ordering will change nothing, so there won't be\nsoft lockup. However, in some special cases, soft lockup would happen.\n\nFix it by `goto fill` to break from the list_for_each_entry.\n\nThe following is a sample of kernel log for this problem.\n\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 26s! [wpa_supplicant:2055]\n[...]\nRIP: 0010:rtw89_entity_recalc ([...] chan.c:392 chan.c:479) rtw89_core\n[...]",
