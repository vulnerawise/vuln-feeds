        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: prevent use-after-free in encode_cap_msg()\n\nIn fs/ceph/caps.c, in encode_cap_msg(), \"use after free\" error was\ncaught by KASAN at this line - 'ceph_buffer_get(arg-\u003exattr_buf);'. This\nimplies before the refcount could be increment here, it was freed.\n\nIn same file, in \"handle_cap_grant()\" refcount is decremented by this\nline - 'ceph_buffer_put(ci-\u003ei_xattrs.blob);'. It appears that a race\noccurred and resource was freed by the latter line before the former\nline could increment it.\n\nencode_cap_msg() is called by __send_cap() and __send_cap() is called by\nceph_check_caps() after calling __prep_cap(). __prep_cap() is where\narg-\u003exattr_buf is assigned to ci-\u003ei_xattrs.blob. This is the spot where\nthe refcount must be increased to prevent \"use after free\" error.",
