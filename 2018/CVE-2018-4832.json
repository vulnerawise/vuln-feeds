Specially crafted messages sent to the RPC service of the affected products could cause a Denial-of-Service condition on the remote and local communication functionality of the affected products. A reboot of the system is required to recover the remote and local communication functionality. Please note that an attacker needs to have network access to the Application Server in order to exploit this vulnerability. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",
