        "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Network Plug and Play server component of Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to configuration data that is stored on an affected NSO system. The vulnerability exists because the Network Plug and Play component performs incomplete validation when configured to use secure unique device identifiers (SUDI) for authentication. An attacker who controls a Cisco device that supports SUDI authentication and has connectivity to an affected NSO system could exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would need to leverage information about the devices that are being registered on the NSO server to send crafted Cisco Network Plug and Play authentication packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to configuration data for devices that will be managed by the NSO system.",
