        "description": "A vulnerability in the folder permissions of Cisco Webex Meetings client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to modify locally stored files and execute code on a targeted device with the privilege level of the user. The vulnerability is due to folder permissions that grant a user the permission to read, write, and execute files in the Webex folders. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to write malicious files to the Webex client directory, affecting all other users of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow a user to execute commands with elevated privileges. Attacks on single-user systems are less likely to occur, as the attack must be carried out by the user on the user's own system. Multiuser systems have a higher risk of exploitation because folder permissions have an impact on all users of the device. For an attacker to exploit this vulnerability successfully, a second user must execute the locally installed malicious file to allow remote code execution to occur.",
