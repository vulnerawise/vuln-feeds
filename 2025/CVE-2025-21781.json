        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbatman-adv: fix panic during interface removal\n\nReference counting is used to ensure that\nbatadv_hardif_neigh_node and batadv_hard_iface\nare not freed before/during\nbatadv_v_elp_throughput_metric_update work is\nfinished.\n\nBut there isn't a guarantee that the hard if will\nremain associated with a soft interface up until\nthe work is finished.\n\nThis fixes a crash triggered by reboot that looks\nlike this:\n\nCall trace:\n batadv_v_mesh_free+0xd0/0x4dc [batman_adv]\n batadv_v_elp_throughput_metric_update+0x1c/0xa4\n process_one_work+0x178/0x398\n worker_thread+0x2e8/0x4d0\n kthread+0xd8/0xdc\n ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\n\n(the batadv_v_mesh_free call is misleading,\nand does not actually happen)\n\nI was able to make the issue happen more reliably\nby changing hardif_neigh-\u003ebat_v.metric_work work\nto be delayed work. This allowed me to track down\nand confirm the fix.\n\n[sven@narfation.org: prevent entering batadv_v_elp_get_throughput without\n soft_iface]",
