        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: ipheth: use static NDP16 location in URB\n\nOriginal code allowed for the start of NDP16 to be anywhere within the\nURB based on the `wNdpIndex` value in NTH16. Only the start position of\nNDP16 was checked, so it was possible for even the fixed-length part\nof NDP16 to extend past the end of URB, leading to an out-of-bounds\nread.\n\nOn iOS devices, the NDP16 header always directly follows NTH16. Rely on\nand check for this specific format.\n\nThis, along with NCM-specific minimal URB length check that already\nexists, will ensure that the fixed-length part of NDP16 plus a set\namount of DPEs fit within the URB.\n\nNote that this commit alone does not fully address the OoB read.\nThe limit on the amount of DPEs needs to be enforced separately.",
