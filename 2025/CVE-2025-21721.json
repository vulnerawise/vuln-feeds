        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: handle errors that nilfs_prepare_chunk() may return\n\nPatch series \"nilfs2: fix issues with rename operations\".\n\nThis series fixes BUG_ON check failures reported by syzbot around rename\noperations, and a minor behavioral issue where the mtime of a child\ndirectory changes when it is renamed instead of moved.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThe directory manipulation routines nilfs_set_link() and\nnilfs_delete_entry() rewrite the directory entry in the folio/page\npreviously read by nilfs_find_entry(), so error handling is omitted on the\nassumption that nilfs_prepare_chunk(), which prepares the buffer for\nrewriting, will always succeed for these.  And if an error is returned, it\ntriggers the legacy BUG_ON() checks in each routine.\n\nThis assumption is wrong, as proven by syzbot: the buffer layer called by\nnilfs_prepare_chunk() may call nilfs_get_block() if necessary, which may\nfail due to metadata corruption or other reasons.  This has been there all\nalong, but improved sanity checks and error handling may have made it more\nreproducible in fuzzing tests.\n\nFix this issue by adding missing error paths in nilfs_set_link(),\nnilfs_delete_entry(), and their caller nilfs_rename().",
