        "description": "A vulnerability in the debug shell of Cisco Video Phone 8875 and Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials with SSH access on the affected device. SSH access is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the debug shell of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSH client command to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information on the underlying operating system.",
