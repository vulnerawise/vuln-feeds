        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before \"getting\" registers\n\nThe x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers\nare XSAVE-managed, but they are \"supervisor state components\" which means\nthat userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that\nthey are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.\nThus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.\n\nThe regset code that ptrace uses provides an -\u003eactive() handler in\naddition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this -\u003eactive() handler\nverifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the\nthread struct. The -\u003eactive() handler is checked from some call sites of\nthe regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not\nunderstood when shadow stack support was put in place.\n\nAs a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with\nXFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to\nreturn NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an\nssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack\nbehavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That\ncheck just happened to avoid the warning.\n\nBut the -\u003eget() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks\ndisabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina\nSchimpe:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1773 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c:198 ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\n? show_regs+0x6e/0x80\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? __warn+0x91/0x150\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? report_bug+0x19d/0x1b0\n? handle_bug+0x46/0x80\n? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80\n? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n? __pfx_ssp_get+0x10/0x10\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? ssp_get+0x52/0xa0\n__regset_get+0xad/0xf0\ncopy_regset_to_user+0x52/0xc0\nptrace_regset+0x119/0x140\nptrace_request+0x13c/0x850\n? wait_task_inactive+0x142/0x1d0\n? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x90\narch_ptrace+0x102/0x300\n[...]\n\nEnsure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up\nin the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] are\nset at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be\nsomething to find in the XSAVE buffer.\n\n[ dhansen: changelog/subject tweaks ]",
