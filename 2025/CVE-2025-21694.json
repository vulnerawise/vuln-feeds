        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore (part 2)\n\nSince commit 5cbcb62dddf5 (\"fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore\") the\nnumber of softlockups in __read_vmcore at kdump time have gone down, but\nthey still happen sometimes.\n\nIn a memory constrained environment like the kdump image, a softlockup is\nnot just a harmless message, but it can interfere with things like RCU\nfreeing memory, causing the crashdump to get stuck.\n\nThe second loop in __read_vmcore has a lot more opportunities for natural\nsleep points, like scheduling out while waiting for a data write to\nhappen, but apparently that is not always enough.\n\nAdd a cond_resched() to the second loop in __read_vmcore to (hopefully)\nget rid of the softlockups.",
