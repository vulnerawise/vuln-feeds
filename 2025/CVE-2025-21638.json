        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: sysctl: auth_enable: avoid using current-\u003ensproxy\n\nAs mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net'\nstructure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:\n\n- Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only\n  from the opener's netns.\n\n- current-\u003ensproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'\n  (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by\n  syzbot [1] using acct(2).\n\nThe 'net' structure can be obtained from the table-\u003edata using\ncontainer_of().\n\nNote that table-\u003edata could also be used directly, but that would\nincrease the size of this fix, while 'sctp.ctl_sock' still needs to be\nretrieved from 'net' structure.",
