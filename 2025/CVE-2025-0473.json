        "description": "Vulnerability in the PMB platform that allows an attacker to persist temporary files on the server, affecting versions 4.0.10 and above. This vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality on the ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’ endpoint. When a file is uploaded via this resource, the server will create a temporary file that will be deleted after the client sends a POST request to ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’. This workflow is automated by the web client, however an attacker can trap and launch the second POST request to prevent the temporary file from being deleted.",
