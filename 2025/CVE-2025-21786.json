        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nworkqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool\n\nThe commit 68f83057b913(\"workqueue: Reap workers via kthread_stop() and\nremove detach_completion\") adds code to reap the normal workers but\nmistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting\nfor the rescuer in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug\nreported by Cheung Wall.\n\nTo avoid the use-after-free bug, the poolâ€™s reference must be held until\nthe detachment is complete. Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq\nafter detaching the rescuer from the pool.",
