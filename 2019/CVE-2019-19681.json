        "description": "Pandora FMS 7.x suffers from remote code execution vulnerability. With an authenticated user who can modify the alert system, it is possible to define and execute commands as root/Administrator. NOTE: The product vendor states that the vulnerability as it is described is not in fact an actual vulnerability. They state that to be able to create alert commands, you need to have admin rights. They also state that the extended ACL system can disable access to specific sections of the configuration, such as defining new alert commands",
