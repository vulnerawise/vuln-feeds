An authenticatd attacker with network access to the DCOM interface could execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system. Successful exploitation requires authentication with a low-privileged user account and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise confidentiality and integrity and availability of the affected system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",
