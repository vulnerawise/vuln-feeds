        "description": "Rejected reason: Format string vulnerability in the University of Washington (UW) c-client library, as used by the UW IMAP toolkit imap-2007d and other applications, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the initial request to the IMAP port (143/tcp).  NOTE: Red Hat has disputed the vulnerability, stating \"The Red Hat Security Response Team have been unable to confirm the existence of this format string vulnerability in the toolkit, and the sample published exploit is not complete or functional.\"  CVE agrees that the exploit contains syntax errors and uses Unix-only include files while invoking Windows functions",
