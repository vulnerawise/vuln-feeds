        "description": "A vulnerability in the forwarding of transit TCPv6 packets received on the Ethernet management interface of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to trigger a kernel panic, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of these transit packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only occurs when TCPv6 packets are routed through the management interface. Other transit traffic, and traffic destined to the management interface, are unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue was introduced as part of a TCP Parallelization feature added in Junos OS 17.2, and affects systems with concurrent network stack enabled. This feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled (see WORKAROUND section below). This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S9; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S4; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S4, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 17.2R1.",
