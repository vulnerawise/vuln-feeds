        "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco\u0026nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization checking and gain restricted access to the configuration information of an affected system.\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software has insufficient input validation for certain commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the affected commands of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authorization checking and gain restricted access to the configuration data of the affected system.Cisco\u0026nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
