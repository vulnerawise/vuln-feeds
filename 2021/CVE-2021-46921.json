        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlocking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()\n\nWhile this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can\nacquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops\nchecking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly\nacquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed\nsuccessfully which isnâ€™t ordered. This exposes the window between the\nacquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads\nfollowing the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before\nthe write lock is truly acquired.\n\nWe've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while\nholding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from\nunder it.\n\n  Writer                                | Reader\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ep_scan_ready_list()                  |\n  |- write_lock_irq()                   |\n      |- queued_write_lock_slowpath()   |\n\t|- atomic_cond_read_acquire()   |\n\t\t\t\t        | read_lock_irqsave(\u0026ep-\u003elock, flags);\n     --\u003e (observes value before unlock) |  chain_epi_lockless()\n     |                                  |    epi-\u003enext = xchg(\u0026ep-\u003eovflist, epi);\n     |                                  | read_unlock_irqrestore(\u0026ep-\u003elock, flags);\n     |                                  |\n     |     atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed()     |\n     |-- READ_ONCE(ep-\u003eovflist);        |\n\nA core can order the read of the ovflist ahead of the\natomic_cmpxchg_relaxed(). Switching the cmpxchg to use acquire\nsemantics addresses this issue at which point the atomic_cond_read can\nbe switched to use relaxed semantics.\n\n[peterz: use try_cmpxchg()]",
