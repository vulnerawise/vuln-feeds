        "description": "An Incorrect Behavior Order vulnerability in the MAP-E automatic tunneling mechanism of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to send certain malformed IPv4 or IPv6 packets to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the PFE on the device which is disabled as a result of the processing of these packets. Continued receipt and processing of these malformed IPv4 or IPv6 packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects MPC 7/8/9/10/11 cards, when MAP-E IP reassembly is enabled on these cards. An indicator of compromise is the output: FPC [\"FPC ID\" # e.g. \"0\"] PFE #{PFE ID # e.g. \"1\"] : Fabric Disabled Example: FPC 0 PFE #1 : Fabric Disabled when using the command: show chassis fabric fpcs An example of a healthy result of the command use would be: user@device-re1\u003e show chassis fabric fpcs Fabric management FPC state: FPC 0 PFE #0 Plane 0: Plane enabled Plane 1: Plane enabled Plane 2: Plane enabled Plane 3: Plane enabled Plane 4: Plane enabled Plane 5: Plane enabled Plane 6: Plane enabled Plane 7: Plane enabled This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC 7/8/9/10/11 cards, when MAP-E IP reassembly is enabled on these cards. 17.2 version 17.2R1 and later versions; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S9; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S12, 17.4R3-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S6, 18.2R3-S3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S1; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S5, 19.3R3.
