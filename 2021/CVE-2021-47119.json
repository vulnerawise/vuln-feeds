        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super\n\nBuffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev();\notherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not\nbe freed by kill_bdev, and subsequently that bh will be leaked.\n\nIf blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will kill current buffers and\npage cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread\nagain but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't\nfully free superblock page and buffer head, and being busy, they were\nnot freed and instead leaked.\n\nThis can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:\n\n  systemctl start \u003cext4_on_lvm\u003e.mount, and\n  systemctl stop \u003cext4_on_lvm\u003e.mount\n\n... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and\nthe bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never\ngets freed, and memory consumption is much more easily noticed.",
