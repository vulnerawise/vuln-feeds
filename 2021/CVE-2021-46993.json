        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: Fix out-of-bound access in uclamp\n\nUtil-clamp places tasks in different buckets based on their clamp values\nfor performance reasons. However, the size of buckets is currently\ncomputed using a rounding division, which can lead to an off-by-one\nerror in some configurations.\n\nFor instance, with 20 buckets, the bucket size will be 1024/20=51. A\ntask with a clamp of 1024 will be mapped to bucket id 1024/51=20. Sadly,\ncorrect indexes are in range [0,19], hence leading to an out of bound\nmemory access.\n\nClamp the bucket id to fix the issue.",
