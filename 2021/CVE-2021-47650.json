        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: soc-compress: prevent the potentially use of null pointer\n\nThere is one call trace that snd_soc_register_card()\n-\u003esnd_soc_bind_card()-\u003esoc_init_pcm_runtime()\n-\u003esnd_soc_dai_compress_new()-\u003esnd_soc_new_compress().\nIn the trace the 'codec_dai' transfers from card-\u003edai_link,\nand we can see from the snd_soc_add_pcm_runtime() in\nsnd_soc_bind_card() that, if value of card-\u003edai_link-\u003enum_codecs\nis 0, then 'codec_dai' could be null pointer caused\nby index out of bound in 'asoc_rtd_to_codec(rtd, 0)'.\nAnd snd_soc_register_card() is called by various platforms.\nTherefore, it is better to add the check in the case of misusing.\nAnd because 'cpu_dai' has already checked in soc_init_pcm_runtime(),\nthere is no need to check again.\nAdding the check as follow, then if 'codec_dai' is null,\nsnd_soc_new_compress() will not pass through the check\n'if (playback + capture != 1)', avoiding the leftover use of\n'codec_dai'.",
