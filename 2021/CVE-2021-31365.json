        "description": "An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX2300, EX3400 and EX4300 Series platforms allows an adjacent attacker sending a stream of layer 2 frames will trigger an Aggregated Ethernet (AE) interface to go down and thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS). By continuously sending a stream of specific layer 2 frames an attacker will sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
