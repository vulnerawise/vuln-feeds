        "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability manifests when a user or an application uploads unprotected private key data as part of an authentication certificate keyCredential  on an Azure AD Application or Service Principal (which is not recommended).

Refer to the FAQ section for more information.\nFor more details on this issue, please refer to the MSRC Blog Entry.\n",
