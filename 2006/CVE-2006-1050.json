        "description": "Kwik-Pay Payroll 4.2.20, and possibly other versions, stores the KwikPay.mdb database file with insecure permissions, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information such as employment and payment data.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this vulnerability, stating that \"The kwikpay.mdb file supplied with kwikpay is a template for the database structure of user databases created by kwikpay and to store a demonstration payroll. It does not contain any sensitive user information.  When a user payroll database is opened, the encryption of the database is checked and if the database is not encrypted, the user is prompted to encrypt the database, but the choice is the customers.",
