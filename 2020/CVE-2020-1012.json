        "description": "\u003cp\u003eAn elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Wininit.dll handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute code with elevated permissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the Wininit.dll properly handles objects in memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
