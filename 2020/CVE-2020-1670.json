        "description": "On Juniper Networks EX4300 Series, receipt of a stream of specific IPv4 packets can cause Routing Engine (RE) high CPU load, which could lead to network protocol operation issue and traffic interruption. This specific packets can originate only from within the broadcast domain where the device is connected. This issue occurs when the packets enter to the IRB interface. Only IPv4 packets can trigger this issue. IPv6 packets cannot trigger this issue.
