        "description": "An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. The External Command Certificate Validator, which allows administrators to upload external linters to validate certificates, is supposed to save uploaded test certificates to the server. An attacker who has gained access to the CA UI could exploit this to upload malicious scripts to the server. (Risks associated with this issue alone are negligible unless a malicious user already has gained access to the CA UI through other means, as a trusted user is already trusted to upload scripts by virtue of having access to the validator.)",
