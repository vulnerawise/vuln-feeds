        "description": "Rejected reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a vulnerability. Notes: The fix resolved an issue when MACsec replay-protect was enabled and the replay-protect-window value was set to zero, Junos OS was incorrectly configuring the value to MAX_WINDOW size. Hence this is not a vulnerability and this CVE ID assignment has been withdrawn",
