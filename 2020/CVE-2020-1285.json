        "description": "\u003cp\u003eA remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in the memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to open an email attachment or click a link in an email or instant message.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince users to open the document file.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows GDI handles objects in the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
