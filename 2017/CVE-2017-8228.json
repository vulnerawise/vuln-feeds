        "description": "Amcrest IPM-721S V2.420.AC00.16.R.20160909 devices mishandle reboots within the past two hours. Amcrest cloud services does not perform a thorough verification when allowing the user to add a new camera to the user's account to ensure that the user actually owns the camera other than knowing the serial number of the camera. This can allow an attacker who knows the serial number to easily add another user's camera to an attacker's cloud account and control it completely. This is possible in case of any camera that is currently not a part of an Amcrest cloud account or has been removed from the user's cloud account. Also, another requirement for a successful attack is that the user should have rebooted the camera in the last two hours. However, both of these conditions are very likely for new cameras that are sold over the Internet at many ecommerce websites or vendors that sell the Amcrest products. The successful attack results in an attacker being able to completely control the camera which includes being able to view and listen on what the camera can see, being able to change the motion detection settings and also be able to turn the camera off without the user being aware of it. Note: The same attack can be executed using the Amcrest Cloud mobile application.",
