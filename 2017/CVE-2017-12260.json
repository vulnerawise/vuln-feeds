        "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) functionality in Cisco Small Business SPA50x, SPA51x, and SPA52x Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of SIP request messages by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using formatted specifiers in a SIP payload that is sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition that persists until the device is restarted manually. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business SPA50x, SPA51x, and SPA52x Series IP Phones that are running firmware release 7.6.2SR1 or earlier. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc63986.",
