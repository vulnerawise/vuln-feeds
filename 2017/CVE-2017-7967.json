        "description": "All versions of VAMPSET software produced by Schneider Electric, prior to V2.2.189, are susceptible to a memory corruption vulnerability when a corrupted vf2 file is used. This vulnerability causes the software to halt or not start when trying to open the corrupted file. This vulnerability occurs when fill settings are intentionally malformed and is opened in a standalone state, without connection to a protection relay. This attack is not considered to be remotely exploitable. This vulnerability has no effect on the operation of the protection relay to which VAMPSET is connected. As Windows operating system remains operational and VAMPSET responds, it is able to be shut down through its normal closing protocol.",
