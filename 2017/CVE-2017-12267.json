        "description": "A vulnerability in the Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) accelerator feature for the Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an ICA application optimization-related process to restart, resulting in a partial denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improperly aborting a connection when an unexpected protocol packet is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted ICA traffic through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition that is due to a process unexpectedly restarting. The Cisco WAAS could drop ICA traffic while the process is restarting. This vulnerability affects Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) and Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve74457.",
