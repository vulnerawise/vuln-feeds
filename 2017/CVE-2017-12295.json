        "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data about the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to the HTTP header reply from the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server to the client, which could include internal network information that should be restricted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by attempting to use the HTTP protocol and looking at the data in the HTTP responses from the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server. An exploit could allow the attacker to discover sensitive data about the application. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve65818.",
