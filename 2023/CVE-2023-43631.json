        "description": "\nOn boot, the Pillar eve container checks for the existence and content of\n“/config/authorized_keys”.\n\nIf the file is present, and contains a supported public key, the container will go on to open\nport 22 and enable sshd with the given keys as the authorized keys for root login.\n\nAn attacker could easily add their own keys and gain full control over the system without\ntriggering the “measured boot” mechanism implemented by EVE OS, and without marking\nthe device as “UUD” (“Unknown Update Detected”).\n\nThis is because the “/config” partition is not protected by “measured boot”, it is mutable, and\nit is not encrypted in any way.\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values, thus not\ntriggering the “measured boot” mechanism, and having full access to the vault.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThis issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure to Zededa), where the config\npartition measurement was added to PCR13:\n\n• aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141\n\n• 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.\n\nThis issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but it was not included in the measured boot.",
