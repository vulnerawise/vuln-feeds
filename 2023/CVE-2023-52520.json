        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: think-lmi: Fix reference leak\n\nIf a duplicate attribute is found using kset_find_obj(), a reference\nto that attribute is returned which needs to be disposed accordingly\nusing kobject_put(). Move the setting name validation into a separate\nfunction to allow for this change without having to duplicate the\ncleanup code for this setting.\nAs a side note, a very similar bug was fixed in\ncommit 7295a996fdab (\"platform/x86: dell-sysman: Fix reference leak\"),\nso it seems that the bug was copied from that driver.\n\nCompile-tested only.",
