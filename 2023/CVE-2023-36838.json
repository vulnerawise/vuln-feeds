        "description": "An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the flow processing daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges, to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIf a low privileged user executes a specific CLI command, flowd which is responsible for traffic forwarding in SRX crashes and generates a core dump. This will cause temporary traffic interruption until the flowd process is restarted automatically. Continued execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series:\nAll versions prior to 20.2R3-S7;\n20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S6;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S4;\n21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4;\n21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3;\n22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S1;\n22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3;\n22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2;\n22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S1, 22.4R2.\n",
