        "description": "Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). The file upload function allows APK and arbitrary files to be uploaded. By exploiting this issue, attackers may upload HTML files and share the download URL pointing to these files with the victims. As the file download function returns the file in inline mode, the victim’s browser will immediately render the content of the HTML file as a web page. As a result, the uploaded client-side code will be evaluated and executed in the victim’s browser, allowing attackers to perform common XSS attacks.",
