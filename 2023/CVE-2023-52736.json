        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda: Do not unset preset when cleaning up codec\n\nSeveral functions that take part in codec's initialization and removal\nare re-used by ASoC codec drivers implementations. Drivers mimic the\nbehavior of hda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in\nsound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c with their component-\u003eprobe/remove() instead.\n\nOne of the reasons for that is the expectation of\nsnd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to an instance of\nstruct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once sound card\ncomponents probing commences.\n\nAs ASoC sound card may be unbound without codec device being actually\nremoved from the system, unsetting -\u003epreset in\nsnd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with module unload -\u003e load\nscenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned only once, during\ndevice/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver's module reloading may\noccur several times throughout the lifetime of an audio stack.",
