        "description": "Arm provides multiple helpers to clean \u0026 invalidate the cache\nfor a given region.  This is, for instance, used when allocating\nguest memory to ensure any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing)\nhave reached memory before handing over the page to a guest.\n\nUnfortunately, the arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and would\nthen result to skip the cache cleaning/invalidation.  Therefore there\nis no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.\n\nThis undefined behavior was meant to be addressed by XSA-437, but the\napproach was not sufficient.",
