        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: fix NULL deref on tls_sw_splice_eof() with empty record\n\nsyzkaller discovered that if tls_sw_splice_eof() is executed as part of\nsendfile() when the plaintext/ciphertext sk_msg are empty, the send path\ngets confused because the empty ciphertext buffer does not have enough\nspace for the encryption overhead. This causes tls_push_record() to go on\nthe `split = true` path (which is only supposed to be used when interacting\nwith an attached BPF program), and then get further confused and hit the\ntls_merge_open_record() path, which then assumes that there must be at\nleast one populated buffer element, leading to a NULL deref.\n\nIt is possible to have empty plaintext/ciphertext buffers if we previously\nbailed from tls_sw_sendmsg_locked() via the tls_trim_both_msgs() path.\ntls_sw_push_pending_record() already handles this case correctly; let's do\nthe same check in tls_sw_splice_eof().",
