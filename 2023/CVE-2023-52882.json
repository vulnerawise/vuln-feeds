        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: sunxi-ng: h6: Reparent CPUX during PLL CPUX rate change\n\nWhile PLL CPUX clock rate change when CPU is running from it works in\nvast majority of cases, now and then it causes instability. This leads\nto system crashes and other undefined behaviour. After a lot of testing\n(30+ hours) while also doing a lot of frequency switches, we can't\nobserve any instability issues anymore when doing reparenting to stable\nclock like 24 MHz oscillator.",
