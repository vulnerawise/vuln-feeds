        "description": "Tuleap is a Free \u0026 Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. Affected versions are subject to a cross site scripting attack which can be injected in the name of a color of select box values of a tracker and then reflected in the tracker administration. Administrative privilege is required, but an attacker with tracker administration rights could use this vulnerability to force a victim to execute uncontrolled code in the context of their browser. This issue has been addressed in Tuleap Community Edition version 14.5.99.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
