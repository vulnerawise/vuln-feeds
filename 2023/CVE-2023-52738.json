        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu/fence: Fix oops due to non-matching drm_sched init/fini\n\nCurrently amdgpu calls drm_sched_fini() from the fence driver sw fini\nroutine - such function is expected to be called only after the\nrespective init function - drm_sched_init() - was executed successfully.\n\nHappens that we faced a driver probe failure in the Steam Deck\nrecently, and the function drm_sched_fini() was called even without\nits counter-part had been previously called, causing the following oops:\n\namdgpu: probe of 0000:04:00.0 failed with error -110\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000090\nPGD 0 P4D 0\nOops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\nCPU: 0 PID: 609 Comm: systemd-udevd Not tainted 6.2.0-rc3-gpiccoli #338\nHardware name: Valve Jupiter/Jupiter, BIOS F7A0113 11/04/2022\nRIP: 0010:drm_sched_fini+0x84/0xa0 [gpu_sched]\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n amdgpu_fence_driver_sw_fini+0xc8/0xd0 [amdgpu]\n amdgpu_device_fini_sw+0x2b/0x3b0 [amdgpu]\n amdgpu_driver_release_kms+0x16/0x30 [amdgpu]\n devm_drm_dev_init_release+0x49/0x70\n [...]\n\nTo prevent that, check if the drm_sched was properly initialized for a\ngiven ring before calling its fini counter-part.\n\nNotice ideally we'd use sched.ready for that; such field is set as the latest\nthing on drm_sched_init(). But amdgpu seems to \"override\" the meaning of such\nfield - in the above oops for example, it was a GFX ring causing the crash, and\nthe sched.ready field was set to true in the ring init routine, regardless of\nthe state of the DRM scheduler. Hence, we ended-up using sched.ops as per\nChristian's suggestion [0], and also removed the no_scheduler check [1].\n\n[0] https://lore.kernel.org/amd-gfx/984ee981-2906-0eaf-ccec-9f80975cb136@amd.com/\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/amd-gfx/cd0e2994-f85f-d837-609f-7056d5fb7231@amd.com/",
