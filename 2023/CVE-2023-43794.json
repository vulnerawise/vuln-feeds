        "description": "Nocodb is an open source Airtable alternative. Affected versions of nocodb contain a SQL injection vulnerability, that allows an authenticated attacker with creator access to query the underlying database. By supplying a specially crafted payload to the given an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to be executed. Since this is a blind SQL injection, an attacker may need to use time-based payloads which would include a function to delay execution for a given number of seconds. The response time indicates, whether the result of the query execution was true or false. Depending on the result, the HTTP response will be returned after a given number of seconds, indicating TRUE, or immediately, indicating FALSE. In that way, an attacker can reveal the data present in the database. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.111.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-141`.",
