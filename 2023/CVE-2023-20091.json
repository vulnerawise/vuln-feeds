        "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files that are on the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have a remote support user account.\r\nCisco\u0026nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
