        "description": "A certain software build for the Sharp Rouvo V device (SHARP/VZW_STTM21VAPP/STTM21VAPP:12/SP1A.210812.016/1KN0_0_530:user/release-keys) leaks the Wi-Fi MAC address and the Bluetooth MAC address to system properties that can be accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in this instance they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. This malicious app reads from the \"ro.boot.wifi_mac\" system property to indirectly obtain the Wi-Fi MAC address and reads the \"ro.boot.bt_mac\" system property to obtain the Bluetooth MAC address.",
