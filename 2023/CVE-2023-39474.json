        "description": "Inductive Automation Ignition downloadLaunchClientJar Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Inductive Automation Ignition. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious server.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the downloadLaunchClientJar function. The issue results from the lack of validating a remote JAR file prior to loading it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user.\n.
