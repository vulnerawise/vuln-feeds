        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: lib/mpi - Fix unexpected pointer access in mpi_ec_init\n\nWhen the mpi_ec_ctx structure is initialized, some fields are not\ncleared, causing a crash when referencing the field when the\nstructure was released. Initially, this issue was ignored because\nmemory for mpi_ec_ctx is allocated with the __GFP_ZERO flag.\nFor example, this error will be triggered when calculating the\nZa value for SM2 separately.",
