        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsysv: don't call sb_bread() with pointers_lock held\n\nsyzbot is reporting sleep in atomic context in SysV filesystem [1], for\nsb_bread() is called with rw_spinlock held.\n\nA \"write_lock(\u0026pointers_lock) =\u003e read_lock(\u0026pointers_lock) deadlock\" bug\nand a \"sb_bread() with write_lock(\u0026pointers_lock)\" bug were introduced by\n\"Replace BKL for chain locking with sysvfs-private rwlock\" in Linux 2.5.12.\n\nThen, \"[PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix\" in Linux 2.6.8 fixed the\nformer bug by moving pointers_lock lock to the callers, but instead\nintroduced a \"sb_bread() with read_lock(\u0026pointers_lock)\" bug (which made\nthis problem easier to hit).\n\nAl Viro suggested that why not to do like get_branch()/get_block()/\nfind_shared() in Minix filesystem does. And doing like that is almost a\nrevert of \"[PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix\" except that get_branch()\n from with find_shared() is called without write_lock(\u0026pointers_lock).",
