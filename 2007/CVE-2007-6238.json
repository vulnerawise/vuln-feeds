NOTE: this information is based upon a vague advisory by a vulnerability information sales organization that does not coordinate with vendors or release advisories with actionable information.  A CVE has been assigned for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to determine.  However, the organization has stated that this is different than CVE-2007-6166.",
